# 2-3-MixedResults
You will print out the results from the following problems.  First, you should calculate by had what you expect the answers to be.  For example, in the parenthesis of the first problem, you should realize that strictly integer arithmetic is taking place that results in a value of 0 for the parenthesis.

		double dA = 37.9;  
		double dB = 1004.128;  
		int iA = 12; 
		int iB = 18;  

		Problem 1: 57.2 * (iA / iB) + 1  
		Problem 2: 57.2 * ((double)iA / iB) + 1  
		Problem 3: 15 - iA * (dA * 3) + 4  
		Problem 4: 15 - iA * (int)(dA * 3) + 4  
		Problem 5: 15 - iA * ((int)dA * 3) + 4
